{{ config(alias='dim_customer') }}

-- dim_customer.sql
-- Conformed customer dimension, shared by every review fact.
-- Grain: one row per unique (customer_name, nationality) combination.
-- Surrogate key: dbt_utils hash of the natural key, so it is deterministic and
-- identical to the key each fact already stores.
-- Note: reviewers are not identified in the source, so (name, nationality) is
-- the best available proxy for a person. Two different people sharing a name
-- and nationality collapse into one row.
-- Counts and first/latest dates span all four review subjects. A customer who
-- only appears in one subject still gets a row; the other subject counts are 0.
