{{ config(alias='dim_aircraft') }}

-- dim_aircraft.sql
-- Conformed aircraft dimension, shared by airline and seat reviews.
-- Grain: one row per distinct aircraft model string found in either subject.
-- Surrogate key: dbt_utils hash of the model string, so a model keeps the same
-- key it had when the two stars each built their own copy.
-- Capacity is enriched by fuzzy-matching the free-text model against a small
-- canonical family list (see the aircraft macros); the QUALIFY keeps the
-- longest - and therefore most specific - family match per model.
